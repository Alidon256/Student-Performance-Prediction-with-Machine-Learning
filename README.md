## Project Overview
Predicting student performance is a valuable asset for educational institutions and stakeholders to identify at-risk students and enhance learning outcomes. This project leverages regression-based machine learning techniques to forecast GPA based on a variety of academic, demographic, and behavioral features.

## Features
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Feature engineering and selection
- Model training using Ridge Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting
- Hyperparameter tuning for optimal performance
- Model evaluation using various metrics
- Modular and extensible codebase

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Alidon256/Student-Performance-Prediction-with-Machine-Learning.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Student-Performance-Prediction-with-Machine-Learning
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
- Prepare your dataset in the expected format (CSV or similar).
- Adjust configuration files or parameters as needed.
